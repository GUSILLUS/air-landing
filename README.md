# Air HTML Landing Page

## Description

HTML landing Air is a web page designed to attract attention and persuade visitors to take a specific action, such as ordering a product or service, subscribing to a newsletter, downloading an app, etc. The page features a visually appealing design, information about customer benefits, a sales scenario, calls to action, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

The main technologies used during the landing development are:

- HTML: the main markup language used to create the page structure and its elements.
- CSS: the style language used to style the web page, set colors, sizes, and other visual design properties.
- SCSS allowed the use of variables, mixins, nested styles, operators, and other functions that simplify the process of writing CSS code.
- [SWIPER](https://swiperjs.com/) slider: used to develop a nice and feature-rich slider on the page.
- JavaScript: the programming language to add interaction and animation to the menu, form validation, and configure Swiper properties.
- Responsive design: a technology that allowed the creation of a web page optimized for different screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
